**Last Updated:** October 21, 2025

## Introduction

Welcome to Envive. We are committed to protecting your privacy and the privacy of your family. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.

**For Parents:** We take children's privacy seriously and comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Please read this policy carefully before allowing your child to use Envive.

- **Email address** (for account authentication)

- **Age** (for children's profiles, to provide age-appropriate features)
- **Role** (parent or child designation)
- **Profile picture/avatar** (optional, if you choose to upload one)

## How We Use Your Information

1. **Provide Core Services:**
   - Authenticate your account and manage user sessions
   - Create and manage household groups
   - Enable parent-child account linking
   - Track and verify completed tasks
   - Manage screen time controls and app limits

## App Category Classification

Envive is classified as a **Family/Parental Control** app, not a Kids Category app. While children use the app under parental supervision, the app is designed for parents to manage their household and requires parental account creation first. This app is intended for mixed audiences: parents (18+) and their children (ages 4-17) under direct parental supervision.

## Third-Party Services and Data Sharing

We use the following third-party service providers and share data as described:

### Supabase (Backend Infrastructure)
- **Data Stored:** Email address, full name, age (for child profiles), household information, task completion data, and verification photos
- **Purpose:** Application database, user authentication, and data storage
- **Location:** Supabase secure cloud servers (encrypted in transit and at rest)
- **Data Shared:** Only the personal information necessary to provide our services
- **Privacy Policy:** [https://supabase.com/privacy](https://supabase.com/privacy)
- **Your Control:** You can request deletion of all data at any time
- **Security:** Supabase provides the same level of protection for user data as stated in this privacy policy

### Apple Sign In
- **Data Shared:** Apple-verified email address and name (optional, based on your Apple ID settings)
- **Purpose:** Secure account authentication without requiring separate password creation
- **Privacy Policy:** [https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/)
- **Important:** When you use Apple Sign In, Apple's privacy practices also apply

### Apple Family Controls API
- **Data Usage:** Screen time monitoring and app usage patterns (ON-DEVICE ONLY)
- **Purpose:** Enable parental screen time management features
- **Critical:** Screen time data NEVER leaves your device, is NOT transmitted to our servers, and is NOT shared with Apple or any third parties beyond standard iOS system operations
- **Storage:** All screen time data remains exclusively on the local device

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

**We do not sell your personal information.** We may share your information only in these limited circumstances:

- **Within Your Household:** Information is shared between parent and child accounts within the same household (by design)
- **Legal Requirements:** If required by law, court order, or government request
- **Service Providers:** With trusted third parties who help us operate our service (like Supabase)
- **Safety:** To protect the safety of our users or the public

## Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)

Envive is designed for families with children under 13 years of age. We comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) requirements.

### Verifiable Parental Consent (VPC) Process

**CRITICAL:** Children under 13 cannot create accounts independently. We obtain verifiable parental consent through the following methods:

1. **Parent Account Creation First**
   - Only adults 18 years or older can create parent accounts
   - Parents must verify their email address through a confirmation link
   - Parents authenticate using either:
     - Email/password authentication (email verified)
     - Apple Sign In (age-verified through Apple ID, which requires users to be 13+)

2. **Explicit Child Profile Authorization**
   - Only parent account holders can create child profiles
   - Parents explicitly enter their child's name and age
   - Parents acknowledge they are the legal parent/guardian when adding children
   - Child profiles cannot be created without an active, verified parent account

3. **Household Control Architecture**
   - Child accounts cannot exist independently - they must be linked to a parent account
   - Children can only join households using parent-generated invite codes
   - Parents maintain complete administrative control over all child profiles
   - All child data is accessible and manageable by the parent

4. **Ongoing Parental Control**
   - Parents can review all child data at any time through the app
   - Parents can modify or delete child profiles instantly
   - Parents receive notifications about child activities
   - Only parents can adjust privacy and data collection settings

This multi-layered approach ensures that only verified parents can authorize data collection from children under 13, meeting COPPA's verifiable parental consent requirements.

### Data Collection from Children

We only collect the following information from children under 13, and ONLY with verifiable parental consent:

- **Name:** To personalize the child's experience
- **Age:** To provide age-appropriate features and content
- **Task completion data:** To track chores and reward screen time
- **Photos:** Only verification photos for completed tasks (optional)
- **Screen time usage:** Monitored locally on-device only (never transmitted to servers)

**We do NOT collect from children:**
- Email addresses
- Phone numbers
- Precise geolocation
- Social security numbers
- Any other personal contact information

### COPPA Compliance Requirements

- ✅ **Parental Consent:** Required before any data collection from children under 13
- ✅ **Limited Collection:** We collect only the minimum information necessary for the app to function
- ✅ **No Advertising:** We do not show any advertising to children, targeted or otherwise
- ✅ **No Third-Party Tracking:** We do not use third-party analytics or tracking on child accounts
- ✅ **No Third-Party Sharing:** Children's information is never sold or shared with third parties for marketing purposes
- ✅ **Parental Control:** Parents can review, delete, or modify their child's information at any time
- ✅ **Direct Notice:** This privacy policy serves as direct notice to parents about our data practices

### Parents' Rights Under COPPA

### Age Verification and Protection

- We do not allow children to create accounts without parental authorization
- The app requires role selection (Parent or Child) during onboarding
- Only Parent roles can create households and add children
- Child roles can only join existing households with parent-provided codes
- We verify that account creators are adults through email verification or Apple Sign In age verification

## Data Security

We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your information:

- Data encryption in transit (HTTPS/TLS)
- Secure authentication via Apple Sign In and Supabase Auth
- Access controls to limit who can view data
- Regular security updates and monitoring

However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
