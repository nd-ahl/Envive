## Key Architecture Details

### Screen Time Controls (Parent)

The parent's Screen Time/App Management controls are accessed via:
- **Location**: ParentDashboardView.swift:42-52
- **Access**: "Apps" button in top-right toolbar
- **Opens**: `AppManagementView` with `AppSelectionStore`
- **Features**:
  - App/category blocking
  - FamilyControls integration
  - ManagedSettings configuration

**OLD (Removed)**: The old `ParentControlView` tab has been removed from parent navigation since the new `AppManagementView` is more integrated and accessible from the dashboard.

### Shared Model

Both parent and child modes use:
```swift
@StateObject private var model = EnhancedScreenTimeModel()
```

This provides:
- `appSelectionStore` - For Screen Time API
- `notificationManager` - For push notifications
- `cameraManager` - For photo management
- `friendActivities` - For social features

### Mode Switching

The floating mode switcher button (top-right) allows instant switching between parent and child roles for testing.

## File Modified

- `/EnviveNew/Views/Shared/RootNavigationView.swift`

## Testing the Features

### As Child:
1. Switch to Child mode
2. See all 5 tabs: Home, Tasks, Social, Photos, Profile
3. "Home" tab has screen time session management
4. "Tasks" tab shows new task dashboard with assignments
5. All original functionality intact

### As Parent:

2. See 4 tabs: Dashboard, Children, Activity, Settings
