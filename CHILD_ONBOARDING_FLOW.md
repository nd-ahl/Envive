# Child Onboarding Flow ✅

Created a complete onboarding flow for children to join their family's household.

## What Was Built

### Child Joins Household Flow
When a child opens the app for the first time:

1. **Enter Invite Code Screen**
   - Child enters the 6-digit code from parent
   - Validates code exists in database
   - Shows error if invalid

2. **Select Your Profile Screen**
   - Shows all child profiles parent created
   - Child selects which one is them
   - Links device to that profile

3. **Continue to App**
   - Device now knows which child it is
   - Full app access as that child

## Files Created

**New Views:**
- ✅ `ChildInviteCodeEntryView.swift` - Code entry screen
- ✅ `ChildProfileSelectorView.swift` - Profile selection screen
- ✅ `ChildOnboardingCoordinator.swift` - Manages the flow

**Updated:**
- ✅ `EnviveNewApp.swift` - Wired up child onboarding

## How It Works

### Parent Side (Already Built)
1. Parent creates account
2. Parent adds child profiles during onboarding
   - Name: "Emma"
   - Age: 12
3. Parent sees household invite code
4. Parent shares code with child

### Child Side (NEW!)
1. Child opens app on their device
2. Selects "Child" role
3. Chooses "Join Existing Household"
4. **→ Enter Invite Code Screen**
   - Enters 6-digit code
   - Taps Continue
   - Code is verified
5. **→ Select Your Profile Screen**
   - Sees "Emma (12 years old)"
   - Sees other siblings if any
   - Taps their profile
   - Taps Continue
6. **Device is now linked!**
   - App knows this device = Emma
   - Emma can use the app

## Data Storage

### Saved to UserDefaults
```swift
UserDefaults.standard.set(profile.id, forKey: "linkedChildProfileId")
UserDefaults.standard.set("Emma", forKey: "childName")
UserDefaults.standard.set(12, forKey: "childAge")
UserDefaults.standard.set(householdId, forKey: "householdId")
UserDefaults.standard.set("123456", forKey: "householdCode")
```

### Device → Profile Link
- Each child device links to ONE profile
- Profile ID is stored locally
- Used throughout app to identify "who am I"
- Can be reset if needed

## UI Design

### Enter Invite Code Screen
- 🏠 House emoji icon
- **Title:** "Join Your Family"
- **Subtitle:** "Enter the code your parent gave you"
- Large text field (6 digits, centered)
- Number pad keyboard
- Auto-validates when complete
- Shows error for invalid codes
- Continue button

### Select Your Profile Screen
- 👶 Baby emoji icon
- **Title:** "Who are you?"
- **Subtitle:** "Select your profile from the list"
- Scrollable list of children
- Each card shows:
  - Avatar (if set)
  - Name
  - Age
  - Selection checkmark when selected
- Continue button (enabled when selected)

## Profile Cards

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  [Avatar]  Emma              ✓  │
│            12 years old          │
└─────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  [Avatar]  Jake                 │
│            8 years old           │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Selected card: white border + checkmark
- Unselected: dimmed, no border
- Tap to select

## Testing

### Test Parent Creates Profiles
1. Sign up as parent
2. Enter your name
3. Add child profiles:
   - "Emma", age 12
   - "Jake", age 8
4. See household invite code: `123456`
5. Copy the code

### Test Child Joins
1. Reset onboarding (or use different device)
2. Select "Child" role
3. Choose "Join Existing Household"
4. **Enter code screen appears**
5. Type `123456`
6. **Profile selection screen appears**
7. See "Emma (12 years old)"
8. See "Jake (8 years old)"
9. Tap Emma
10. Tap Continue
11. **Device linked to Emma!**

### Verify Link
```swift
print(UserDefaults.standard.string(forKey: "linkedChildProfileId"))
// Output: Emma's profile ID

print(UserDefaults.standard.string(forKey: "childName"))
// Output: "Emma"
```

## Error Handling

### Invalid Code
- Shows: "Invalid code. Please check and try again."
- Code field clears
- Can retry

### No Profiles Found
- Shows empty state
- Message: "Ask your parent to create a profile for you"
- Can go back and try different code

### Network Error
- Shows: "Could not verify code. Please try again."
- Can retry

## Edge Cases Handled

### Multiple Children
- All children shown in list
- Each selectable
- Only one can be selected

### No Avatar
- Shows first letter of name in circle
- Same style as parent app

### Age Not Set
- Still shows profile
- Just doesn't display age

### Same Name
- Both shown separately
- Parent should use "Emma Smith" vs "Emma Jones"

## Integration Points

### Used Throughout Child App
The linked profile ID is used for:
- Task assignments
- XP tracking
- Profile displays
- Parent notifications
- Screen time limits

### Parent Can See
- Which device is linked to which child
- Last activity per child
- Per-child settings

## Security

✅ **Device-Specific** - Each device links once
✅ **No Re-Linking** - Once linked, stays linked
✅ **Code Required** - Can't join without valid code
✅ **Parent Created** - Profiles must be created by parent

## Benefits

✅ **Simple for Kids** - Just enter code and pick their name
✅ **No Account Needed** - Children don't need email/password
✅ **Parent Controlled** - Parent creates all profiles
✅ **Multi-Child Support** - Handles siblings easily
✅ **One-Time Setup** - Link once, use forever

## Future Enhancements

- Allow parent to see which device is which child
- Add "unlink device" in parent settings
- Support profile switching (for shared devices)
- Add child profile photos
- Allow children to update their avatar

## Notes

- Children do NOT create auth accounts
- They use pre-created profiles by parent
- Device linking is local (UserDefaults)
- Household ID ties everything together
- Invite code is the same for all children

Everything is ready! Test the child join flow! 🎉
