### ‚ö†Ô∏è THIS ACTION IS PERMANENT AND IRREVERSIBLE

1. **All user data will be permanently deleted**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Issue: Auth User Deletion

The `auth.users` table is managed by Supabase Auth. Depending on your Supabase configuration:
- Direct SQL deletion may be blocked by Supabase
- You may need to delete users from the **Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí **Authentication** ‚Üí **Users** tab
- If SQL deletion fails, manual dashboard deletion is required

5. **UNCOMMENT STEP 2** - Remove the `/*` and `*/` comments
6. **RUN THE SCRIPT**
7. **VERIFY STEP 3** - Confirm all counts are 0

### Option 2: Manual Deletion (If SQL fails)

1. Go to **Authentication** ‚Üí **Users** in Supabase Dashboard
2. Delete all users manually
3. Go to **Table Editor** ‚Üí **profiles** ‚Üí Delete all rows
