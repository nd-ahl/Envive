# Age Picker Update - Complete! âœ…

Updated the child profile creation to use the scroll wheel age picker instead of birthday selector.

## What Changed

### 1. Created Reusable Component
**New File:** `Views/Shared/AgePickerWheel.swift`
- Extracted the scroll wheel from `AgeSelectionView`
- Can be used anywhere in the app
- Customizable age range (default 5-17 for children)
- Optional label display

### 2. Updated Child Profile Creation
**Changed from:** Birthday date picker
**Changed to:** Age scroll wheel (5-17 years)

**Files Updated:**
- `ChildProfileData` - Changed `birthday: Date` â†’ `age: Int`
- `AddChildProfileSheet` - Uses `AgePickerWheel` component
- `AddProfilesView` - Displays "X years old" instead of birthday

### 3. Auto-Close Modal
âœ… Modal now closes automatically when parent taps "Save Profile"
- Prevents accidental multiple saves
- Better UX flow

### 4. Removed Parent Age Selection
âœ… Parents no longer asked for their age during onboarding
- Age is only collected for children during profile setup
- Onboarding flow is shorter

### 5. Updated Database Schema
**Changed from:** `birthday DATE`
**Changed to:** `age INTEGER`

**Migration:** `005_add_profile_fields.sql`
```sql
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN age INTEGER;
```

1. Welcome Screen
2. Onboarding Questions

10. Benefits
11. Main App

## How It Works Now

### Adding a Child Profile

1. Tap **Add Profile** button
2. Modal slides up
3. **Add photo** (optional)
4. **Enter name** (required)
5. **Select age** with scroll wheel (5-17)
6. Tap **Save Profile**
7. **Modal closes automatically** âœ¨
8. Profile card appears with "Name, X years old"

### The Scroll Wheel

- Ages 5-17 for children
- Same beautiful design from existing onboarding
- Smooth scrolling with large numbers
- Background highlight on selected age
- Reusable component for settings later

## Reusing the Age Picker

The `AgePickerWheel` component can be used anywhere:

```swift
// In parent settings or "Add Child" screen later
AgePickerWheel(
    selectedAge: $childAge,
    ageRange: 5...17,
    showLabel: false // Hide the big number display
)
```

**Parameters:**
- `selectedAge`: Binding to Int
- `ageRange`: ClosedRange<Int> (default 5-17)
- `showLabel`: Bool (shows/hides big age display)

## Data Storage

### Database
- Children's ages stored as `INTEGER` in `profiles.age`
- Can be updated as child gets older
- Used for age-appropriate content filtering

### Display
- Shows as "X years old" in profile cards
- Used in parent dashboard child selector
- Can calculate birth year if needed

## Testing

### Test the Age Wheel
1. Reset onboarding or delete app
2. Go through onboarding
3. Sign in/create account
4. Tap **Add Profile**
5. Scroll the age wheel - smooth!
6. Select an age (try different ages)
7. Tap **Save Profile**
8. **Modal closes automatically**
9. See profile card with age displayed

### Test Multiple Children
1. Add first child (e.g., "Emma, 12")
2. Modal closes
3. Tap **Add Profile** again
4. Add second child (e.g., "Jake, 8")
5. Modal closes
6. See both cards with different ages

### Test Editing
1. Tap **Edit** (pencil icon) on a profile
2. Age wheel shows current age
3. Change the age
4. Tap **Save Profile**
5. Modal closes
6. Age updated in card

## Files Changed

### New Files
- âœ… `Views/Shared/AgePickerWheel.swift` - Reusable component

### Modified Files
- âœ… `AddChildProfileSheet.swift` - Uses age wheel, auto-closes
- âœ… `AddProfilesView.swift` - Displays age, saves age
- âœ… `DatabaseModels.swift` - Profile uses `age: Int?`
- âœ… `HouseholdService.swift` - Creates profiles with age
- âœ… `OnboardingManager.swift` - Skips parent age step
- âœ… `005_add_profile_fields.sql` - Age column instead of birthday

## Database Setup

**Before testing, run this migration:**

```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS age INTEGER;
COMMENT ON COLUMN profiles.age IS 'User age in years, primarily for child profiles';
```

Or just run the updated `database/migrations/005_add_profile_fields.sql` file.

## Benefits

### Better UX
- âœ… Faster input (scroll vs typing date)
- âœ… No date picker complexity
- âœ… Age is what parents think in
- âœ… Auto-close prevents errors
- âœ… Consistent with existing design

### Simpler Data
- âœ… Store integer, not date
- âœ… Easier age-based logic
- âœ… No timezone issues
- âœ… No birth date privacy concerns

### Reusable Code
- âœ… Same component everywhere
- âœ… Use in settings later
- âœ… Use for editing profiles
- âœ… Consistent user experience

## Next Steps

Once tested:
1. Use age for task recommendations
2. Age-based content filtering
3. Add age to parent settings "Add Child" screen
4. Consider age reminders (birthday month)
5. Age-based XP multipliers

## Notes

- Parent age selection completely removed from onboarding
- Children ages range from 5-17 years
- Age wheel component is reusable across the app
- Modal auto-closes on save to prevent duplicate saves
- All data stored as integer, not dates

Everything is ready! Build and test the new age picker flow! ðŸŽ‰
