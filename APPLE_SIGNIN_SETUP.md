# Apple Sign In Setup Guide

I've already added the Sign in with Apple capability to your Xcode project! ‚úÖ

Now you need to configure it in your Apple Developer account and Supabase. Follow these steps:

---

## Part 1: Apple Developer Account Setup

### Step 1: Get Your Bundle ID

Your app's Bundle ID is: **com.neal.EnviveNew**

(You'll need this for the next steps)

---

### Step 2: Create an App ID (if not already created)

1. Go to: https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list
2. Click the **"+"** button to create a new identifier
3. Select **"App IDs"** and click **Continue**
4. Select **"App"** and click **Continue**
5. Fill in:
   - **Description**: Envive
   - **Bundle ID**: com.neal.EnviveNew (Explicit)
6. Scroll down and check **"Sign in with Apple"**
7. Click **Continue**, then **Register**

**If your App ID already exists:**
1. Find it in the list and click on it
2. Scroll down and check **"Sign in with Apple"**
3. Click **Save**

---

### Step 3: Create a Services ID (REQUIRED for Supabase)

This is what Supabase needs to authenticate users.

1. Go to: https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list
2. Click the **"+"** button
3. Select **"Services IDs"** and click **Continue**
4. Fill in:
   - **Description**: Envive Sign In
   - **Identifier**: `com.neal.EnviveNew.signin` (this can be anything, but keep it related to your app)
5. Click **Continue**, then **Register**

**‚ö†Ô∏è SAVE THIS IDENTIFIER!** You'll need it for Supabase.

---

### Step 4: Configure the Services ID

1. In the Services IDs list, click on the one you just created
2. Check the box for **"Sign in with Apple"**
3. Click **Configure** next to "Sign in with Apple"
4. In the dialog that appears:
   - **Primary App ID**: Select your app (com.neal.EnviveNew)
   - **Domains and Subdomains**: Add `vevcxsjcqwlmmlchfymn.supabase.co`
   - **Return URLs**: Add `https://vevcxsjcqwlmmlchfymn.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
5. Click **Next**, then **Done**
6. Click **Continue**, then **Save**

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important URLs to add:**
```
Domain: vevcxsjcqwlmmlchfymn.supabase.co
Return URL: https://vevcxsjcqwlmmlchfymn.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
```

---

### Step 5: Create a Sign in with Apple Key

This is the authentication key Supabase uses to verify Apple sign-ins.

1. Go to: https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/authkeys/list
2. Click the **"+"** button
3. Fill in:
   - **Key Name**: Envive Apple Sign In Key
4. Check the box for **"Sign in with Apple"**
5. Click **Configure** next to "Sign in with Apple"
6. Select your **Primary App ID**: com.neal.EnviveNew
7. Click **Save**
8. Click **Continue**, then **Register**

**‚ö†Ô∏è DOWNLOAD THE KEY FILE!**
- Click **Download** - you'll get a `.p8` file
- **SAVE THIS FILE!** You can only download it once!
- Also **SAVE THE KEY ID** shown on the page (it's a 10-character code like "ABC123DEFG")

---

### Step 6: Get Your Team ID

1. Go to: https://developer.apple.com/account
2. Look for **"Team ID"** on the right side of the page
3. **SAVE THIS!** It's a 10-character code

---

## Part 2: Supabase Configuration

Now let's connect everything to Supabase.

### Step 1: Open Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/vevcxsjcqwlmmlchfymn
2. Click **"Authentication"** in the left sidebar
3. Click **"Providers"** tab

---

### Step 2: Enable Apple Provider

1. Find **"Apple"** in the list of providers
2. Click to expand it
3. Toggle **"Enable Sign in with Apple"** to ON
4. Fill in the following:

**Services ID:**
```
com.neal.EnviveNew.signin
```
(The Services ID you created in Apple Developer)

**Client Secret (JWT):**
This is tricky - you need to generate a JWT token. But don't worry, I'll give you an easier method below.

---

### Step 3: Generate the Client Secret (JWT)

**Option A: Use Supabase's Helper (Easiest)**

Supabase has a helper tool! Let's use it:

1. In the Apple provider settings, look for a link that says **"Generate a JWT"** or similar
2. Fill in:
   - **Secret Key ID**: (The Key ID from your .p8 file download)
   - **Team ID**: (Your Apple Team ID)
   - **Client ID (Services ID)**: com.neal.EnviveNew.signin
   - **Secret Key**: (Open the .p8 file in a text editor and paste the contents)
3. Click **Generate** and it will create the JWT for you
4. Copy the generated JWT into the **"Secret (for OAuth)"** field

**Option B: Manual Method**

If Supabase doesn't have the helper, use this website:
1. Go to: https://jwt.io
2. In the **Payload** section, paste:
```json
{
  "iss": "YOUR_TEAM_ID",
  "iat": 1234567890,
  "exp": 1850000000,
  "aud": "https://appleid.apple.com",
  "sub": "com.neal.EnviveNew.signin"
}
```
3. Replace `YOUR_TEAM_ID` with your actual Team ID
4. In the **Verify Signature** section:
   - Select **ES256** algorithm
   - Paste your .p8 key content
   - Add the Key ID in the header section
5. Copy the generated JWT

---

### Step 4: Save Supabase Configuration

1. After filling in all the fields in Supabase
2. Click **Save**
3. Apple Sign In is now enabled! üéâ

---

## Part 3: Test It!

### Build and Run Your App

1. Open Xcode
2. Select a real device (not simulator) - Apple Sign In doesn't work in simulator
3. Build and run the app (‚åòR)
4. Go through onboarding
5. When you reach the Sign In screen, tap **"Sign in with Apple"**
6. It should show the Apple authentication dialog!

---

## Quick Checklist

Before testing, make sure you have:

- [x] ‚úÖ App ID created with Sign in with Apple enabled
- [ ] Services ID created (com.neal.EnviveNew.signin)
- [ ] Services ID configured with Supabase domain and callback URL
- [ ] Sign in with Apple Key created and downloaded (.p8 file)
- [ ] Team ID saved
- [ ] Key ID saved
- [ ] Supabase Apple provider enabled with all credentials
- [ ] App tested on a real device

---

## Troubleshooting

**Error: "Invalid client"**
- Check that your Services ID is correct in Supabase
- Make sure the Services ID is configured with the correct domains

**Error: "Invalid redirect URI"**
- Make sure you added the exact callback URL in Apple Developer:
  `https://vevcxsjcqwlmmlchfymn.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`

**Apple Sign In button doesn't appear**
- Make sure you're testing on a real device, not simulator
- Check that the entitlements file has Sign in with Apple capability

**Error: "Invalid JWT"**
- Regenerate the JWT with the correct Team ID and Key
- Make sure the .p8 key content is correct

---

## Summary: What You Need

From Apple Developer:
1. **Services ID**: `com.neal.EnviveNew.signin`
2. **Team ID**: (10-character code)
3. **Key ID**: (10-character code from .p8 download)
4. **.p8 Key File**: (Downloaded file)

For Supabase:
1. Services ID ‚Üí Goes in "Services ID" field
2. Generated JWT ‚Üí Goes in "Secret (for OAuth)" field
