9. **Performance Optimization**: Location services and battery usage
10. **Privacy Audit**: Ensure compliance with child privacy regulations

## Test User Setup Requirements

### **Current Test Users (Development Database)**
- **Parent Test User**: `parent@test.com` (ID: `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`)
- **Child Test User**: `child@test.com` (ID: `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002`)
- **Test Relationship**: Pending invitation created between parent and child

### **Development Testing Workflow**
1. **Create User Switcher**: Debug menu to switch between parent/child test users
2. **Test Relationship Flow**:
   - Parent sends invitation to child
   - Child receives and accepts/rejects invitation
   - Verify relationship appears in both user interfaces
3. **Test Screen Time Management**: Parent sets limits for child, child earns time through tasks
4. **Test Family Features**: Location sharing, task assignment, progress monitoring

### **Required Implementation Tasks**
- [ ] User type selection during onboarding
- [ ] Parent invitation system (email/phone lookup)
- [ ] Child acceptance/rejection workflow
- [ ] Development user switcher interface
- [ ] Parent dashboard with child oversight
- [ ] Child interface showing parent-assigned tasks/limits
