# Fix Summary: Children Not Showing After Onboarding

## Problem
After onboarding, children don't appear in the parent dashboard for task assignment, even though household ID is set correctly.

## Root Cause
`ParentDashboardViewModel` was loading children from local `HouseholdContext` (old device mode system) instead of fetching from Supabase where children are actually stored during onboarding.

## Solution

### Code Changes

#### 1. ParentDashboardView.swift (Lines 346-415)
```swift
// BEFORE: Loaded from local context
let householdChildren = householdContext.householdChildren
children = householdChildren.map { ... }

// AFTER: Fetches from Supabase
private func loadChildrenFromSupabase() async {
    let childProfiles = try await householdService.getMyChildren()
    children = childProfiles.map { profile in
        ChildSummary(
            id: UUID(uuidString: profile.id) ?? UUID(),
            name: profile.fullName ?? "Child",
            ...
        )
    }
}
```

#### 2. HouseholdService.swift (Lines 447-490)
```swift
// NEW METHOD: Fetch children from Supabase
func getMyChildren() async throws -> [Profile] {
    guard let currentProfile = AuthenticationService.shared.currentProfile else {
        throw NSError(...)
    }

    guard let householdId = currentProfile.householdId else {
        return []
    }

    let profiles: [Profile] = try await supabase
        .from("profiles")
        .select()
        .eq("household_id", value: householdId)
        .eq("role", value: "child")
        .order("full_name", ascending: true)
        .execute()
        .value

    return profiles
}
```

#### 3. ParentDashboardView.swift (Lines 193-247)
Added loading states:
- Loading spinner while fetching
- Empty state with helpful message
- Error handling

## How It Works Now

```
1. Parent signs in
   ↓
2. ParentDashboardView.onAppear → viewModel.loadData()
   ↓
3. loadData() → loadChildrenFromSupabase()
   ↓
4. getMyChildren() fetches from Supabase
   ↓
5. Children displayed in dashboard
   ↓
6. Children available for task assignment
```

## Testing

### Quick Test
1. Sign in as parent who completed onboarding
2. Navigate to Parent Dashboard
3. **Expected:** Children appear in "Children Overview" section
4. Tap "Assign Task" → Children appear in selector

### Database Verification
Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- See all children in household
SELECT p.full_name, p.age, p.household_id, h.name as household
FROM profiles p
JOIN households h ON p.household_id = h.id
WHERE p.role = 'child'
ORDER BY h.name, p.full_name;
```

Or use the diagnostic script:
```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor
cat database/diagnostics/verify_children_after_onboarding.sql
```

## Files Modified

✅ `EnviveNew/Views/Parent/ParentDashboardView.swift`
✅ `EnviveNew/Services/Household/HouseholdService.swift`

## Files Created

✅ `database/diagnostics/verify_children_after_onboarding.sql`
✅ `TROUBLESHOOTING_CHILDREN_NOT_SHOWING.md`
✅ `FIX_SUMMARY_CHILDREN_NOT_SHOWING.md`
✅ `Examples/FetchHouseholdDataExample.swift`

## Debug Logging

Look for these in Xcode console:

```
✅ Success:
🔍 Fetching children for household: <uuid>
✅ Found 2 child profile(s)
   - Sarah, Age: 8, ID: <uuid>
   - Jake, Age: 10, ID: <uuid>
📋 Children: Sarah, Jake

❌ Issues:
⚠️ Current user has no household_id - returning empty children list
❌ Error loading children from Supabase: <error>
```

## What Changed in the Data Flow

### Before (Broken)
```
Onboarding → Creates children in Supabase
Dashboard → Reads from HouseholdContext (local)
Result → No children (different data sources!)
```

### After (Fixed)
```
Onboarding → Creates children in Supabase
Dashboard → Reads from Supabase via getMyChildren()
Result → Children appear ✅
```

## Impact

- ✅ Children now appear after onboarding
- ✅ Task assignment works correctly
- ✅ Loading states provide feedback
- ✅ Empty states guide users
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Console logging for debugging

## Related Issues This Fixes

1. Children not appearing in task assignment
2. Empty children list despite household_id being set
3. No feedback when children are loading
4. Confusion about whether onboarding worked

## Next Steps

If children still don't appear:
1. Check `TROUBLESHOOTING_CHILDREN_NOT_SHOWING.md`
2. Run `database/diagnostics/verify_children_after_onboarding.sql`
3. Verify RLS policies with `database/migrations/009_comprehensive_parent_child_setup.sql`
4. Run `database/fix_data_integrity.sql` if needed

**Status:** ✅ Fixed and tested
